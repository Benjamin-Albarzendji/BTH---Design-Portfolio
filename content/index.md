About me
==========================

This is the home page of my portfolio site. My name is Benjamin Albarzendji and I like Star Wars. Therefore I have chosen baby Yoda (Grogu) as a picture that represents me. Otherwise, I am 31-years old, I have worked abroad for the United Nations and I have lived in 7 countries. I am taking this course to become a software engineer. My logo is a watermelon because it is tasty.
